- 👋 Hi, I’m @SlimSandman
- 👀 I’m the monster who kills monsters.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a hitman for one of Lucifer's lousy Generals...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on being a bad kinda good-guy. You know, an Anti-hero.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Haha, you don't. I reach you.
- 🌚 I'm the shadow in the night!!! Mwhahaha!

sorry, I've been bingeing Richard Kadrey's "Sandman Slim" book series... What a work of art!
